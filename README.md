# SW-algorithm

## Introduction
This is the answer to hw1 for CBB752 class at Yale University.
The programming task is to implement the Smith-Waterman local alignment algorithm for protein sequences. To be mentioned, the affine gap penalty is applied to this code.

## Dependencies
The script is written with Python3.6, using Numpy1.19.2 and Pandas1.1.3 packages
Installing these two packages, `pip3 install numpy`, `pip3 install pandas`

## Installation
`pip install git+https://https://github.com/chang0704/SW-algorithm.git`

## Implemetation
By running the script, you can use the following line:
python hw1.py -i <input file> -s <score file> -out <output file>
